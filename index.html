          <p><span style="background-color: yellow">The Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest form of rental assistance for low-income families in the U.S. Despite its reputation as urban-focused, vouchers serve families in almost every county in Pennsylvania &mdash; rural and urban. But as with all forms of housing assistance, the need greatly exceeds supply.</span></p>

          <section class="step">
            <h2>The Burden</h2>
            <p>Today, low income households across rural and urban Pennsylvania struggle with the cost of their rent or mortgage. The state sits at the crux of both national trends &mdash; rising rents in cities, a hangover from the 2008 financial crisis, stagnating or declining incomes &mdash; and local ones, among them rural price booms spurred by the influx of the shale drilling industry.</p>
            
            <p>Regardless of where or why, more money spent on simple shelter means less for food, education, or savings for a rainy day. It also means greater vulnerability to bad breaks, when an illness or a factory closing could easily end in a family’s homelessness.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <h2>The Vouchers</h2>
            <p>Housing Choice Vouchers help relieve this cost burden by allowing households earning less than 50% of the Area Median Income &mdash; approximately $29,600 for a family of three &mdash; to pay 30% of their monthly income for a reasonably priced apartment on the private market. The federal government, by way of local housing authorities, pays the rest.</p>
          
            <p>Vouchers are the largest form of federal housing rental assistance in the country, but the program is often considered a primarily urban one. More vouchers are concentrated in cities due to higher populations and generally higher need.</p>    
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>But vouchers are used in almost every county of Pennsylvania. Rural Potter and Fulton counties rival Philadelphia in how many vouchers they receive relative to their total households.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="step">
            <p>Overall, the Housing Choice Voucher program makes housing affordable for over 78,000 households in Pennsylvania, serving over 176,500 people.</p>

            <p>Still, that leaves over 700,000 households—approximately 1.5 million people &mdash; across the state that are very or extremely low income, housing cost burdened, and not receiving either a housing choice voucher or another of the two major forms of federal rental assistance. Almost 70,000, or around 10%, of those households live in rural counties. The federal government only funds the program enough to serve 21% of Pennsylvania families that need it, resulting in families waiting up to 10 years before they reach the top of the list or waiting years just to get on a list.<p>

          <section class="step">
            <h2>The Divide</h2>
            <p>On November 8th, 2016, almost six million Pennsylvanians went to the polls to elect the next president of the United States. The state’s unexpected turn toward Donald Trump helped marshal in a new era of uncertainty in federal housing policy. While Housing Choice Vouchers have long enjoyed bipartisan support, both Trump and HUD Secretary Ben Carson have railed against federal aid for low-income communities that, they say, create dependencies, and proposed dramatic cuts to housing programs. Though the federal budget passed through September increased housing spending, authorities across Pennsylvania have closed their voucher waiting lists and even revoked vouchers in anticipation of decreased funding and greater vulnerability to come.</p>     
          </section>
          
          <section class="step">
            <p>A deep rural/urban divide is central to many of the popular narratives explaining Trump’s rise to the presidency, part of which supposedly stems from government programs that fail to address the needs of voters outside metropolitan areas. But many rural counties across Pennsylvania are as well-served by the voucher program as urban centers. Many rural areas also sport high proportions of households that are eligible for vouchers but remain unserved, similar to or greater than seen in urban areas.</p>

            <p>Rural areas depend on Housing Choice Vouchers just as cities do, and many rural counties sorely need more rental assistance for low-income households struggling to stay sheltered. As rhetoric turns into budgets, rural counties that went to Trump stand to lose the same deeply needed support that their urban counterparts will.</p>
